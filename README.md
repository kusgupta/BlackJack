# BlackJack
To run my game, simply execute: python BlackJack.py

In a terminal that can run python programs.

I chose to simply use a list of numbers that represented the cards in a 52 card deck to simplify choosing a card, and then preshuffled the deck by using a built in python function, then just drew from the back of the deck.

Additionally, I chose to typical casino rules for how my dealer plays so that he hits whenever his score is less than 17.

I chose to write in Python because it was a fast and simple way for me to implement a game like this with Object Oriented code.
